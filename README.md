Hi, I am Olena Zhyvohliad. I have around 7+ years of extensive experience as a PHP developer.
My focus area for the past few years has been back-end development with Yii and Laravel, but I'm also skilled in front-end development with Vue.js.

### My Life Philosophy ###
 ```Always do something you are a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of 'Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough.```

_Marissa Mayer_
